Variant : Whois tazatel

Program will take IP/hostname in option 'q' and IP/hostname of Whois server in option 'w',will query a whois server specified by option 'w' and will display information about IP/hostname specified in option 'q', obtained through Whois.

Program takes 3 arguments :     -q <IP|hostname>, compulsory argument
    				-w <IP|hostname of WHOIS server>, which will be queried, compulsory argument
    				-d <IP>, DNS server which will be queried, optional argument, implicitely DNS resolver in OS will be used
Note to argument 'd' : Feature of arguemnt d is not implemented. Parsing of 'd' argument is working though, so it will only accept valid IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, otherwise display an error. 

Limitations:	- Known Bug: If option 'w' is an IP address not of a whois server, program will still connect to the address and stay connected until interupted.
			     Therefore make sure to input IP address of a whois server. In case incorrect whois server hostname was input, program will display and error and help messeges.
		- No DNS feature: As mentioned before the DNS part of the project, which is also described as Bonus part, was not implemented in the program, therefore no DNS info will be output.
		- Whois Servers : - Most whois servers seem to be outputing data in the similar format. Not all of them though. 
				  This program was tested, will display data from servers : whois.ripe.net , whois.iana.org, whois.nic.cz and ones with similar output format.
				  During testing on whois.arin.net, answer is registered but in some cases will not display information provided by whois.arin.net because of its unusual format. 
				  To display the entire answer from whois server : Uncomment 'puts()' function on line 332 in file isa-tazatel.cpp .
			 	  Also discovered during testing: In case of whois.arin.net sometimes the answer arrives empty. I believe this is an issue of the server not the program.

Compile program with command 'make' in the directory with source file and Makefile.
Then run the program in format : ./isa-tazatel -q <IP|hostname> -w <IP|hostname of WHOIS server> [-d <IP|hostname>]

Examples :	./isa-tazatel -q www.fit.vutbr.cz  -w whois.ripe.net -d 2001:4860:4860::8844
		./isa-tazatel -q seznam.cz -w 217.31.205.42
		./isa-tazatel -q 99.85.128.0 -w whois.arin.net
